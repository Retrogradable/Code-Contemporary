## 👋😁 Howdy! my name's Ryan, but I also go by Retrogradable here on GitHub.

My public portfolio may be a little bit lacking at the moment but I am working on filling it with projects that showcase my actual real-world capabilities soon.

### A Little About Me:
- I've been familiar with code since 2015, but never took programming seriously and challenged myself to build any projects of decent scale until now.
- I studied math and computer science at the junior college level and hold an Associate's in Math and Science.
- I hold a Bachelor's in Mass Communication and Media Studies because I like tech journalism and digital marketing, but decided to pursue a career in tech instead.
- I am currently pursuing a second degree, followed by a Master's in Computer Science.
- I love working with new technologies, and am particularly fond of any projects that involve helping the world in some way.
- I'm very passionate about helping people, interacting with others, and building relationships with good people.
